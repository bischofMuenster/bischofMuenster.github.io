  abstract={How do the tone and style of political messages affect citizens? While research has unpacked which politicians demarcate themselves with their tone and style, we know little about how this resonates with citizens. We theorize that linguistic simplicity, as a communication style, should increase citizens' political knowledge and affect their beliefs about politicians. Simple language is used as a heuristic signaling that politicians are among the ``people'' and this might increase politicians' public support. In pre-registered and large-scale survey experiments conducted in Germany, respondents are shown political statements randomly varying in linguistic simplicity, among other factors. Simplicity increases respondents' political knowledge and is used by them as a heuristic to fill informational gaps about politicians' socio-economic backgrounds. In the electoral arena sophistication moderates the effect of politicians' policy positions. Our findings showcase that linguistic styles can be a major tool for contemporary political campaigns.}
